Nice to meet you there! This is Yuhang Wu, a first-year PhD student at [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), working toward the PhD degree in Computer Science supervised by Prof. [Jia Hu](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?web_id=jh815) and Prof. [Geyong Min](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?username=gm321). My research interests are cooperative perception, autonomous driving, internet of vehicles and federated learning.

Prior to that, I received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Communications Engineering from the Shanghai Maritime University and Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, in 2021 and 2024, respectively. My previous researches focus on federated learning, edge computing, blockchain and autonomous driving.
